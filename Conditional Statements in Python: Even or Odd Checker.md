##  Aim
 To write a Python program to check whether the given character is a vowel or not using if..else statement

5.If the character is in the list of vowels:
  Display "It is a vowel".

6.Else:

7.End

##  Program
```
a=str(input())
if a =="A" or a =="E" or a =="I" or a =="o" or a =="U":
 print("The given character is a vowel")
else:
 print("The given character is NOT a vowel")
```
